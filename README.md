VidAccessor
===========

VidAccessor is an app for mobile phones and other devices running Google's Android operating system. It allows you to search for captioned mobile video, view it in the YouTube player, share it with friends, rate the captions, and view the sum of everyone's caption ratings on videos and channels. 

VidAccessor was written for the Last Call for Google I/O contest and was one of the 10 winners of Accessibility Round II:
